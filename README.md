# AHK Double Clicker
A simple AHK script to emulate a double-click, which can be found in some mice like the Glorious Model O. 

The script allows the user to specify a percentage, which is the chance of a double click. The script also allows users to add a percentage greater than 100 so that a user can get triple, quadruple etc. clicks if needed. 
For example, 50% means a 50% chance of a double click. 150% would mean a 100% chance of a double click and a 50% chance of a triple click. 

The script can be toggled quickly using another set of hotkeys for the left and right clicks.
